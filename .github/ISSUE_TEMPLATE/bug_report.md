- [ ] I understand that this is a channel for reporting bugs, not a support forum (If you need help configuring the card, go to: [Discussions](https://github.com/flixlix/power-flow-card-plus/discussions)).

- [ ] I have the latest version of the card installed.

- [ ] I have cleared my browser cache **after** installing, updating and configuring the card.

- [ ] The issue is not related to the UI-Editor not being rendered: "s.entries is not a function". This is a known bug, and is caused by Card Mod. Check the warning this [readme section](https://github.com/flixlix/power-flow-card-plus#usage) for more information on how to fix it.
